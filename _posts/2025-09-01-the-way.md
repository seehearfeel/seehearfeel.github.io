Tough times are still ahead   
and we must remain vigilant   
to any unexpected storms.

Live your life the way you like,   
notice the way you like to work,   
and adjust your pace accordingly.

Please create a plan for each day,   
use the plan to organize your day,   
but remember to remain flexible.
