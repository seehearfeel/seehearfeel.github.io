title: Enjoy Life and Work
---

The most important thing in life is   
peace, health and happiness.

Things change, people change,   
ideas change, desires change,   
and now it is time for another change.

Peace of mind to look at things,   
just calm down and take it easy.

The most important thing in work is   
interest, growth and balance.

I want to become a [hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html),   
I need to engage in [deliberate practice](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html),   
I must understand that less is more.

To follow the path:   
look to the master,   
follow the master,   
walk with the master,   
see through the master,   
become the master.
