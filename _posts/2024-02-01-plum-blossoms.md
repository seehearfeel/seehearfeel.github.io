title: Plum Blossoms
---

Other flowers bloom in spring and summer,   
only the plum blossom has the hardihood to   
withstand the bone-piercing cold of winter.

The plum blossom sprigs in the corner of   
the wall, alone bloom in the frosty chill,   
seen from afar I know it is not snow,   
for a hint of the fragrance to come.
