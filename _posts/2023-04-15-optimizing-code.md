you can use a profiler and   
look at the assembly code.

Here are some useful materials:   
[Inline Assembler with Operands](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html)   
[Programming from the Ground Up Book](https://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/pgubook/)   
[Overlooked Essentials for Optimizing Code](https://www.digitalmars.com/articles/b55.html)
