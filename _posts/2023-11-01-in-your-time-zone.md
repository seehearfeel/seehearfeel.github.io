title: In Your Time Zone
---

People around you might seem to be   
ahead of you. Some are behind you.   
Everyone is running their own race.

You are not late.   
You are not early.   
You are very much on time,   
and [in your time zone](https://www.worldpulse.org/story/youre-not-late-youre-not-early-17817).
