Why do I miss my childhood?   
We cannot wait to be grown-ups.   
We yearn for childhood innocence.

Being an adult can be a real drag   
because you have to make all of   
your decisions for yourself.

There is so much to the world   
you have to figure out yourself,   
please try to reduce your workload.
