---

Everything is related.   
Everything is a cycle.   
Sometimes loop is infinite.

Here are some mathematical operations,   
they are very interesting and amazing.   
1 * 1 = 1   
11 * 11 = 121   
111 * 111 = 12321   
1111 * 1111 = 1234321   
11111 * 11111 = 123454321   
111111 * 111111 = 12345654321   
1111111 * 1111111 = 123567654321

Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...   
and Spring is [a thought-provoking story](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374546/)   
about human life, moving from innocence,   
through love and evil, to enlightenment   
and finally rebirth.
