Leaving a job is hard.   
Despite the not-so-good parts,   
you likely had good moments as well.

No matter your reason for leaving,   
there are likely a few positives   
you will be leaving behind as well.

Whether you love or hate your job,   
breaking up with it can be hard.   
Sometimes going away is also a way.
