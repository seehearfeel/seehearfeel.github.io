ROCgdb is the AMD ROCm Debugger,   
it is the AMD source-level debugger   
for Linux, based on the GNU Debugger.

Allows you to set breakpoints,   
single-step ROCm applications,   
and inspect and modify the memory   
and variables of any given thread   
running on the hardware.

The current version of ROCgdb is   
an initial prototype that focuses   
on source line debugging and does   
not support symbolic variable   
debugging capabilities.   
Here is [ROCgdb documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ROCgdb/en/latest/index.html).
