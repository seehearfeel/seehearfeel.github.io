It was an early autumn morning,   
the leaves were beginning to fall,   
a heart-warming story is coming.

[Lost and Found](https://oliverjeffers.com/books/lost-and-found)   
is a children's picture book   
about a boy and a penguin.

A poignant, funny, and child-friendly   
story about friendship lost . . . and   
then found again.
