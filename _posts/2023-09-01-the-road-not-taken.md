title: Two Roads
---

There are two roads,   
which one do I choose?   
what if I choose wrong?

No absolutely right or wrong choice,   
only decision, action and movement,   
growth and engagement are important.

I took the one less traveled by,   
and that has made all the difference,   
[I am happy with that decision anyway](https://poets.org/poem/road-not-taken).
