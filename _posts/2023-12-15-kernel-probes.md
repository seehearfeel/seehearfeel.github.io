title: Kernel Probes
---

Kprobes enables you to break   
into any kernel routine and   
collect debugging information.

Kprobes can change the register set,   
since it operates on a running kernel   
and needs deep knowledge of computer   
architecture and concurrent computing,   
you can easily shoot your foot.

Here are some useful materials:
