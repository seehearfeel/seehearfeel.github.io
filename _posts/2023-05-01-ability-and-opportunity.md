title: Ability and Opportunity
---

Opportunity is very important,   
but the most important is how   
to seize the opportunity.

Value = Ability + Opportunity.   
How to realize self value?   
How to reflect self value?

Knowing where to kick, $9999.   
One kick, $1.

What is your value?   
Not only have the ability   
to know where to kick,   
but also have the opportunity   
to do one kick.

Please notice that   
$9999 + $0 = $0,   
this is logical and;   
$0 + $1 = $0,   
this is also logical and;   
$9999 + $1 = $10000,   
that is arithmetic sum.
