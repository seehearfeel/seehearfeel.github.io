An incorrigible optimist,   
a great humanitarian,   
a friend of the people.

Su Dongpo found escapism and   
inspiration in his “ordinary” life   
to creating extraordinary poetry.

Su may be best known as a poet,   
but he lives on in the scent of   
slowly braising sweet pork and   
the juicy flesh of ripe fruit too.
