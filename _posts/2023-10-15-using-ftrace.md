Ftrace is an internal tracer designed to   
help out developers and designers to find   
what is going on inside the kernel.

Ftrace is [Function Tracer](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/ftrace.html),   
We can [use ftrace to hook to functions](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/ftrace-uses.html),   
and [analyze the Linux kernel with ftrace](https://opensource.com/article/21/7/linux-kernel-ftrace).
