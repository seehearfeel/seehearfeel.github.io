title: Let Go
---

Please let go of the door handle!   
Don't be so worried all the time,   
just let go!

If you let something happen,   
you allow it to happen without   
doing anything to stop or prevent it.   
If you let someone do something,   
you give them your permission to do it.

Let go of negative beliefs,   
create positive beliefs that   
will empower you.

It is time to stop judging.   
You should think about getting   
a side job to bring in some income,   
because it is hard to know if or when   
you will be let go from your main job.
