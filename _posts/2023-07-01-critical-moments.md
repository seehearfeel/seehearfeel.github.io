What do you want?   
What do you have?   
What can you do?

Throughout our long career,   
we will run into various things.

After nearly 3 years,   
we will probably face   
various problems and difficulties.

After nearly 5 years,   
we will probably suffer   
various frustrations and obstacles.

After nearly 8 years,   
we will probably hit   
various slowdowns and bottlenecks.

After nearly 10 years,   
we will probably meet   
various risks and challenges.

If we want to go further,   
it is a much more intelligent idea   
to go slow and steady.

Ready? Go!   
The world makes way for the man   
who knows where he is going.
