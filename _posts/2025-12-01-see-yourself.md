title: See Yourself
---

When we experience failure,   
what we should do is accept it,   
instead of running far away from it.

Please note that failure   
is an event, not a person.   
All the past failure and   
frustration were actually   
laying the foundation for   
the understandings that   
have created the new level   
of living we now enjoy.

How others see you is not important,   
how you see yourself means everything.   
Only you know your own potential.   
Only you can prove yourself.   
Only hard work can get you there.
